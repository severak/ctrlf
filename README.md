shim for chrome's Scroll to Text

[Chrome will Soon Let You Share Link to Specific Word or Sentence on a Page](https://www.chromestory.com/2019/02/chrome-scroll-to-text/), however, there is no such functionality for other browsers.

This repo will contain a cross-browser solution using same link api as chrome. Bookmarklet and/or script for pages.

Steps to implement:

- implement bookmarklet/script for linking
- implement bookmarklet/script on page for highlighting (using [this](https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/3539) and [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/5887719))
- show it to the public [here](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19168442) and [here](https://github.com/bokand/ScrollToTextFragment)
- **Profit!**
